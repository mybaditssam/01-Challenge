It is designed to be viewed in a web browser and includes various sections with information on Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management.

## What's Inside?

It contains:

- images: a folder that contains the images used in the web page.

## How do I View the Web Page?

To view the web page, open the "index.html" file in the web browser of your choice

## Accesibility

Accessiblity standars are followed to ensure that users with disabilities can access and interact with the content. The "index.html" is semantic and the CSS is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.
